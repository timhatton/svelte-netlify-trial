      "description": "The texture and tartness of the apples, combined with the delicate pastry, make this a very delicious pie. Serve warm.  ",
      "contents": "# \r\n\r\n# Ingredients\r\n\r\n## Apple filling\r\n\r\n 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting\r\n\r\n 12 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, and sliced\r\n\r\n 3/4 cup sugar, plus additional for pie top\r\n\r\n Zest and juice of 1 lemon\r\n\r\n 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon\r\n\r\n 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg\r\n\r\n Pinch ground cloves\r\n\r\n 2 tablespoons unsalted butter\r\n\r\n 1 large egg, beaten\r\n\r\n## Pastry\r\n\r\n 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour\r\n\r\n 1 teaspoon coarse salt\r\n\r\n 1 teaspoon sugar\r\n\r\n 1 cup (2 sticks) chilled unsalted butter, cut in pieces - 226.8 grams \r\n\r\n 1/4 to 1/2 cup ice water\r\n\r\n# Directions\r\n\r\n## \r\n\r\n## Pastry\r\n\r\n*   Place the flour, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a food processor, and process for a few seconds to combine. Add the butter, and process until the mixture resembles coarse meal, about 10 seconds. With the machine running, add the ice water in a slow, steady stream, through the feed tube, just until the dough holds together. Do not process for more than 30 seconds.\n\r\n*   Turn the dough out onto a work surface. Divide in two. Place each half on a sheet of plastic wrap. Flatten, and form two discs. Wrap, and refrigerate at least 1 hour before using.\n\n\r\n\r\n## Apple filling\r\n\r\n*   Heat oven to 190 degrees celsius. On a lightly floured surface, roll out pate brisee (dough) into two 1/8-inch-thick circles to a diameter slightly larger than that of an 11-inch plate. Press one pastry circle into the pie plate. Place the other circle on waxed paper, and cover with plastic wrap. Chill all pastry until firm, about 30 minutes.\n\r\n*   In a large bowl, combine apples, sugar, lemon zest and juice, spices, and flour. Toss well. Spoon apples into pie pan. Dot with butter, and cover with remaining pastry circle. Cut several steam vents across top. Seal by crimping edges as desired. Brush with beaten egg, and sprinkle with additional sugar. (I used raw sugar and was very generous which gave it a nice crunch. I also sprinkled a tablespoon over the apples before I put the pastry lid on). \n\r\n*   Bake until crust is brown and juices are bubbling, about 1 hour. Let cool on wire rack before serving. (I served hot!)\n\n\r\n\r\n## Cooking notes\r\n\r\n I made the pastry and filling the night before and assembled and cooked the pie the next day. Leaving the apples overnight in a bowl worked well as half the bowl filled with liquid which I drained the next day before assembling the pie. This meant the juice of the apples didn\u0027t make the pastry soggy.\r\n\r\n Makes one large pie. Serve with cream or vanilla ice-cream. \n",

The meat should be rare to medium stage by then. Remove it from the oven, cover the tray with foil and leave to rest for 5-10 minutes.\n\r\n*   Meanwhile make the sauce. Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a small pan and add the almonds. Cook for 3-4 minutes stirring continuously until the nuts are golden brown and evenly cooked. Remove from the heat and allow to cool a little.\n\r\n*   Place the nuts in a food processor and roughly crush. Mix in the lemon zest and juice, honey, orange blossom water, \u00BD teaspoon of salt, \u00BD teaspoon of pepper and the remaining olive oil. Mix well and set aside.\n\r\n*   When you are ready to serve, carve the lamb into 1cm thick slices and arrange it on a platter along with the peppers and aubergines. Add the freshly chopped herbs to the sauce and spoon on top tossing it all together.\n\r\n*   This can be enough as it is, or you can server it with couscous.\n\n",

Heat the oil and butter in a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan over a medium heat and, when the butter melts, add the leek and and fry gently for a minute, then add 70g ham and cook until the leek has softened, and the ham fat has begun to melt.\n\r\n*   Turn the heat down, gradually stir in the flour and cook gently, stirring regularly, until it loses its raw flavour \u2013 this should take about 8\u201310 minutes.\n\r\n*   Gradually stir in the hot milk, beating it in well, until you have a smooth paste. Cook for another 15 minutes until it has the consistency of smooth mashed potato, then fold through the rest of the ham and the cheese.\n\r\n*   Put the b\u00E9chamel in a bowl and allow to cool, then cover, pressing the clingfilm on to the surface of the sauce to prevent a skin from forming, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.\n\r\n*   Put the beaten eggs into a bowl, and the breadcrumbs into another. With floured hands, roll spoonfuls of the mixture into cylinders and dip these into the egg, then roll in the breadcrumbs until well coated.\n\r\n*   Heat the olive oil in a large pan to 180C and shallow fry the croquetas in batches for a couple of minutes until golden all over and then drain on kitchen paper., or until it begins to shimmer. Keep warm in a low over until ready to serve.\n\n\r\n\r\n **Variations**\r\n\r\n*   Use diced chorizo instead of ham for a spicier version.\n\r\n*   As a boxing day treat this works really well with a bechemel made with left over cheese and Christmas ham.\n\n\n",

Generously flour each side of the dough disk and quickly slap-and-stretch until it is a large thin oval and then place directly onto the grate of a hot barbecue. Cook on each side for a couple of minutes. When done move to a tray and drizzle with a bit of olive oil and cover to keep warm.\n\n\r\n\r\n N.B.

It isn\u0027t exactly the same but it is fine when it isn\u0027t barbie weather.\n\r\n*   Alternatively it can also be done on a very hot griddle pan.\n\r\n*   When baked brush with a few table spoons of olive oil mixed with a few teaspoons of zatar for a middle eastern feel, or brush with garlic infused melted butter and sprinkle with nigella seeds for an Indian feel.\n\n",

Grind as finely as possible in a food processor (a few can be kept back for garnish).\n\r\n*   Put the cream and chocolate in a double boiler and melt until smooth. Allow to cool.\n\r\n*   Make an italian meringue. Start by making a sugar syrup by combining the sugar with 100ml of water and bring to 105C. Beat the egg whites until soft peaks and then, while still beating, slowly drizzle in the hot sugar syrup. Keep beating until the mixture is cool. This will give a very stiff, glossy and stable meringue.\n\r\n*   Combine the nuts with the melted chocolate and then gentle fold in the meringue.\n\r\n*   Put the mixture into a bread tin lined with clingfilm making sure the top is completely covered.\n\r\n*   Put in the freezer for several hours.\n\r\n*   To serve, remove from the freezer about half an hour before hand and then remove from the bread tin and cut into thick slices. Serve with crushed hazelnuts. Also works nucely with kirsh soaked cherries or raspberries,\n\n",

Put it seam side down and cover with the upturned bowl and leave for about 2 hours (less if the house is very warm).\n\r\n*   About 45 minutes before it is time to bake heat the over to 230C with a large casserole pot on a baking stone.\n\r\n*   When ready to bake tidy up the loaf shape and put it on a round piece of baking paper, slash the top and put it into the hot casserole dish and put the whole thing (with lid) in the oven and leave for 20 minutes.\n\r\n*   After the 20 minutes take the loaf out of the dish and return it to the oven (directly on the baking stone) for another 20 minutes or so. If the colour gets too dark turn the over down to 200C.\n\r\n*   Bake until the internal temperature of the loaf is about 95C.\n\r\n*   Leave on a wire rack to cool for at least an hour.\n\n\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n*   Use the percentages and make a smaller loaf with less flour (e.g. 450g)\n\r\n*   The time spent in the fridge is mainly to develope flavour. The exact same technique can be used starting Friday and skipping 24 hours of fridge time.\n\n\r\n\r\n## Variations\r\n\r\n*   Replace 10-20% of the flour with another type, e.g. wholemeal, rye etc.\n\r\n*   To make burger buns double the amount of olive oil and shape into 120g balls and bake for about 20 minutes in a covered dish and then about 10 minutes uncovered. When they come out of the oven wrap them in a tea towel until cool to make a bun with a very soft crust.\n\r\n*   Leave the oil out for a crunchier crust (at the expense of a softer, moister crumb).\n\n",

Rub the mixture with your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.\nSpread the mixture out onto a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper and bake for 7-8 minutes, or until slightly golden-brown and crisp. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool before breaking up into small pieces. Once cooled, store in an airtight container ready for serving.\n\r\n*   For the oranges, zest one orange and set the zest aside. Segment the oranges by cutting off the top and bottom of each orange, then cutting the peel away from the flesh, making sure to remove the pith. Cut into segments.\nPlace the orange liqueur, sugar and orange zest in a small pan and bring to a simmer. Add the orange segments, then remove the pan from the heat and set aside to cool.\n\r\n*   To serve, drain the orange segments and place onto a baking tray. Sprinkle each segment with caster sugar and caramelise using a mini blow torch. Gently heat the outside of the dariole moulds to loosen the panna cotta, then turn onto the serving plates. Sprinkle the almond crumbs around the panna cotta and arrange the caramelised orange segments around. \n\n",
